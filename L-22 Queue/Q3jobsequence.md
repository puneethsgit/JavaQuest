# Job Sequencing Problem

## Problem Explanation

In the **Job Sequencing Problem**, you are given a set of jobs where each job has:

- A **Job ID** (e.g., `a`, `b`, `c`, etc.)
- A **Deadline** (the latest time by which the job must be completed)
- A **Profit** (the profit earned if the job is completed before its deadline)

The objective is to **maximize the total profit** by scheduling the jobs, with the constraint that only **one job can be completed at a time**, and each job takes **1 unit of time**.

### Key Points:

1. **Deadline**: The job must be completed before or at the specified deadline.
2. **Single Unit of Time**: Each job takes 1 unit of time to complete.
3. **One Job at a Time**: Only one job can be executed at a time, so you need to decide which jobs to select to maximize the total profit.
4. **Maximize Profit**: You aim to schedule jobs such that the total profit is maximized, keeping in mind the constraints of deadlines.

### Problem Constraints:

- If a job is completed before or at its deadline, it earns the given profit.
- You cannot complete more than one job at a time.
- The jobs are scheduled in such a way that they finish before their deadlines.

## Input and Output Format:

### Input:

You are given an array of jobs where each job has:

- JobID
- Deadline
- Profit

Example input:
```

JobID Deadline Profit
a 4 20
b 1 10
c 1 40
d 1 30

```

### Output:
The output should be the sequence of job IDs that will yield the maximum profit.

Example output:
```

c, a

```

## Steps to Solve:

1. **Sort the Jobs by Profit**: First, sort the jobs in decreasing order of profit. This ensures that we prioritize jobs with higher profit.

2. **Select Jobs**: Try to schedule jobs in such a way that the job is completed before its deadline. If the job's deadline is already occupied, we try to find an earlier available time slot.

3. **Maximize Profit**: After selecting the jobs, calculate the total profit earned by completing the jobs within their deadlines.

## Example Walkthrough:

### Input:
```

JobID Deadline Profit
a 4 20
b 1 10
c 1 40
d 1 30

```

### Step 1: Sort the Jobs by Profit:
```

JobID Deadline Profit
c 1 40
d 1 30
a 4 20
b 1 10

```

### Step 2: Schedule the Jobs:
- Start with the job with the highest profit, `c` (Profit = 40), and check if it can be scheduled. The deadline for `c` is 1, and we can complete it at time 1.
- Now, the time slot at time 1 is occupied. The next job is `a` (Profit = 20) with a deadline of 4. We can complete it at time 4.
- There are no more jobs that can be completed before their deadlines.

### Output:
The jobs selected are `c` and `a`, which yield the maximum profit.

### Final Answer:
```

c, a

```

# Job Sequencing Problem - Java Code Explanation

## Problem Description

The **Job Sequencing Problem** is a scheduling problem where the goal is to schedule jobs within their deadlines to maximize profit. Each job has:
- A `job_id` (identifier)
- A `deadline` (by when the job must be completed)
- A `profit` (associated with completing the job)

The algorithm aims to select jobs in such a way that the total profit is maximized while adhering to the deadlines.

## Algorithm Used

### Steps Involved:

1. **Job Class:**
   - The `Job` class represents a job with three attributes: `job_id`, `deadline`, and `profit`.

2. **Sorting the Jobs:**
   - The jobs are first sorted based on their deadlines in ascending order.

3. **Max-Heap (Priority Queue):**
   - A max-heap is used to prioritize jobs with higher profits. This ensures that the most profitable jobs are selected first.

4. **Reverse Traversal of Jobs:**
   - The jobs are traversed in reverse order. This is done to schedule the most profitable jobs first while considering available time slots.

5. **Job Selection:**
   - The jobs are added to the max-heap, and the algorithm schedules them in the available slots. The job with the highest profit is selected first.

6. **Sorting the Result:**
   - After selecting the jobs, the result list is sorted based on the job deadlines to maintain the correct order of execution.

7. **Output:**
   - The final job sequence is printed in the order of execution.

### Time Complexity:
- Sorting the jobs takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- The operations involving the max-heap (insertion and extraction) take \(O(\log n)\) for each job, leading to a total time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).

## Java Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {

    // Define a Job class with attributes: job_id, deadline, and profit
    static class Job {
        char job_id;  // Job identifier (e.g., 'a', 'b', etc.)
        int deadline; // Deadline for the job
        int prot;     // Profit associated with the job

        // Constructor to initialize the job attributes
        Job(char job_id, int deadline, int prot) {
            this.deadline = deadline;
            this.job_id = job_id;
            this.prot = prot;
        }
    }

    // Method to print the job sequence that gives maximum profit
    static void printJobScheduling(ArrayList<Job> arr) {
        int n = arr.size();  // Get the number of jobs

        // Sort the jobs based on the deadline (ascending order)
        Collections.sort(arr, (a, b) -> {
            return a.deadline - b.deadline;
        });

        // Create a result list to store the jobs in the selected sequence
        ArrayList<Job> result = new ArrayList<>();

        // Create a max-heap to select jobs with the highest profit
        PriorityQueue<Job> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(
            (a, b) -> { return b.prot - a.prot; }
        );

        // Traverse the jobs in reverse order (from the last job to the first)
        for (int i = n - 1; i > -1; i--) {
            int slot_available;

            // If it's the first job, slot_available is the job's deadline
            if (i == 0) {
                slot_available = arr.get(i).deadline;
            }
            else {
                // Otherwise, calculate the available slots based on the previous job's deadline
                slot_available = arr.get(i).deadline - arr.get(i - 1).deadline;
            }

            // Add the current job to the max-heap (priority queue)
            maxHeap.add(arr.get(i));

            // While there are available slots and jobs in the max-heap
            while (slot_available > 0 && maxHeap.size() > 0) {
                // Extract the job with the highest profit from the heap
                Job job = maxHeap.remove();
                slot_available--;  // Decrease available slots
                result.add(job);    // Add the job to the result list
            }
        }

        // Sort the selected jobs based on their deadlines
        Collections.sort(result, (a, b) -> {
            return a.deadline - b.deadline;
        });

        // Print the job IDs in the order of execution
        for (Job job : result) {
            System.out.print(job.job_id + " ");
        }

        // Print a new line after the job sequence
        System.out.println();
    }

    // Main method to test the job scheduling function
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an ArrayList to store the jobs
        ArrayList<Job> arr = new ArrayList<Job>();

        // Add jobs with their job_id, deadline, and profit
        arr.add(new Job('a', 2, 100));
        arr.add(new Job('b', 1, 19));
        arr.add(new Job('c', 2, 27));
        arr.add(new Job('d', 1, 25));
        arr.add(new Job('e', 3, 15));

        // Print the maximum profit job sequence
        System.out.println("Following is maximum "
                + "profit sequence of jobs");
        printJobScheduling(arr);  // Call the method to print the job sequence
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

This algorithm effectively schedules jobs to maximize profit while adhering to deadlines. It utilizes sorting and a max-heap to ensure that jobs with higher profit are selected first.
