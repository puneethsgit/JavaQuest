/* Given an array of integers Find the inversion count in the array
 INVERSIONCOUNT : For an array, inversion count indicates how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. if the array is already sorted then the inversion count is zero (0). if an array is sorted in the reverse order then inversion count is maximum formally for two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i<j
SAMPLE INPUT : N=5, arr[] = {2,4,1,3,5}
SAMPLE OUTPUT : 3 because it has 3 inversion = (2,1) (4,1) (4,3)
